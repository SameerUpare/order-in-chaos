It was supposed to be a routine weekly status call.
Five minutes in, the tone changed — the client’s frustration was unmistakable.
Every project manager knows that moment — when diplomacy meets delivery under pressure.

## 🧩 Background

Our senior manager hadn’t responded to the customer’s requests for key documents and a Change Request Form (CRF).
I had already informed our internal stakeholders that these were still pending.

To make things more complex, the client’s PM wanted all queries for multiple projects routed through me — even though our team’s focus was only on the current scope.
New requirements, as always, should go through presales.

## ⚙️ Preparing for the Call

Anticipating a tough discussion, my team agreed on three rules:

1.  **Stay calm, professional, and focused.**
2.  **Maintain clear boundaries around scope.**
3.  **Keep communication transparent — no defensiveness.**

## ☎️ During the Call

The client immediately expressed frustration over the missing responses.

I acknowledged their concern and suggested they resend the reminder to the account manager — with me in CC — so I could ensure faster internal follow-up.

When new requirements surfaced, I calmly explained our process:

- Such requests go through the presales channel.
- They aren’t part of the current scope or budget.
- Once approved, our project team can step in.

To my relief, the client accepted this approach.

## 🌤 Restoring Calm and Progress

We then reviewed the latest project status report — line by line.
By being transparent and addressing concerns directly, the conversation shifted from frustration to progress.

By the end of the call, the client said something that stuck with me:

> “At least your team keeps us informed and helps us move forward.”

That acknowledgment made every bit of composure worth it.

## 💡 Key Lessons

- ✅ **Calm is contagious** — it resets the room.
- ✅ **Proactive clarity** prevents escalation later.
- ✅ **Boundaries** protect both delivery focus and stakeholder trust.
- ✅ **Transparency** builds credibility faster than speed ever can.
